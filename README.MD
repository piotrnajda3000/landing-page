# Landing Page

## _[View the site](https://piotrnajda3000.github.io/landing-page/)_

**Project brief:** implement a website from a given design

However, I've reimplemented part of the design in Figma first, as a starting point:

The final outcome:

Website is designed to suit viewports of 1320 px and above. I will implement responsiveness once I learn it.

This is my first foray into SCSS (with BEM).
